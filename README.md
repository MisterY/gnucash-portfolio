# gnucash-portfolio
Tools for managing a portfolio with GnuCash

The purpose of the project is to provide tools that help in managing a portfolio in GnuCash.

The functionality is (to be) built on top of [gnucash-utilities](https://github.com/sdementen/gnucash-utilities) and [piecash](https://github.com/sdementen/piecash).

For this reason, the code will (probably) mostly be written in Python.
