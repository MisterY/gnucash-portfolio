Here are the reports that can be used through gnucash-utilities bridge.
These are to be placed in your <profile dir>\<report name>\
where the report name is the name without extension. i.e.:

```
C:\Users\me\.gnucash\report_simple\report_simple.py
```
After placing the reports in the correct location, run ```gc_report``` to generate the resulting report (.scm) files for GnuCash.
