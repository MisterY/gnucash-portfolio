# Reports

Here are the reports that can be used through `gnucash-utilities` bridge.
These are to be placed, together with their subfolder, in your <profile dir>\.gnucash folder.
i.e.:

```
C:\Users\me\.gnucash\report_simple\report_simple.py
```
After placing the reports in the correct location, run ```gc_report``` to generate the resulting report (.scm) files for GnuCash.
